    <p> In traditional film-based photography, ASA( American Standards Association) was used to determine how sensitive the film was to light. It was measured from 100 and the value would double each time you increment, for example, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1600. In digital photography, the term is now referred to as ISO, but the values still remain the same, but instead the numbers contribute to the sensitivity of the image sensor. The lower the value, the less sensitive to light, whilst the higher value will make the sensor more sensitive to light. </p>

    <p> Higher ISO settings are generally used in darker environments to get a faster shutter speed. One example may be an indoor sport such as gymnastics, where you need to get an action shot in low light conditions. However, the more you increase the ISO the sensor will become more susceptible to noise, creating soft images and video. Therefore, it is always recommended to have good lighting before hand rather than trying to make amendments in post-production. Although more modern cameras are becoming less sensitive to noise and cameras that have larger full frame sensors are resistant to noise in low light. </p>
