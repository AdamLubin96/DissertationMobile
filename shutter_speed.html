    <p>  Shutter speed is determined by the amount of time that the shutter remains open. In the early days of film, photographers and videographers would have to use trial and error and judge the correct amount of exposure needed for a given image. That would of course lead to a lot of time being wasted on development if the image is over or under exposed. In the age of digital photography this has been made a lot simpler with image playback, and most modern mirrorless cameras giving you live readings on areas that are over or under exposed. </p>

    <p> Relating back to shutter speed, the numerical aspect is measured in either seconds or fractions of a second, with the larger denominator contributing to a faster shutter speed. For example, 1/500 would be a lot quicker than 1/50 of a second. In film, the general rule is that the shutter speed should be double that of your frame rate. The reason for that is that values lower than that will introduce a lot of blur and soften the overall image, especially if there is sufficient movement. In order to capture fast moving images, a high shutter speed is required, to eliminate the motion blur. </p>

    <p>        The shutter is open for only a breif period which is as quicker or quiecker than the fans speed of rotation.
       Which is why it appears the fan blades are stationary. </p>
