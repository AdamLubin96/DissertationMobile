    <p>  Focal length is numerical calculation of an optical distance from the point rays of light congregate to form a sharp image on a digital sensor or film. It is common misconception that the millimetres (mm) which is used to measure the distance, refers to the length of the lens or the minimum focusing distance of the lens. Both of these are false. The shorter the focal length, for example 18mm, the wider the angle of view, allowing more content into the frame. On the other end of the scale a 300mm lens which has a long focal length will produce a narrow field of view. Focal length also relates to depth of field as mentioned with aperture. A lens with a low mm is likely to have a deeper depth of field whilst a longer focal length will naturally create a shallow depth of field even if the aperture is not completely wide open. Although there are some exceptions to hat rule as some wide-angle lenses have apertures as low as 1.8, but these tend to be on the higher end of the pricing scale. </p>

    <p> There are also two types of lenses, zooms and primes. Zoom lenses tend to be very versatile as they give you the option to seamlessly alter your focal length, prior and during your shoot. They are ideal for shooting a combination of different shots from wide right up to macro photography. One of the drawbacks of a zoom lens is that they can be quite heavy due to the added glass elements, and they tend to have variable aperture which means as you zoom in, the aperture will get smaller, which will chance the balance of your seen, if you zoom whilst in video. Some of the budget end zooms also tend not to be as sharp as their prime equivalent as the image will get softer the more glass you add. Prime lenses, tend to be incredibly light weight, they are more likely to have a larger aperture and produce much sharper images at the same focal length of a zoom. However, the downside is that the focal length is fixed. </p>
