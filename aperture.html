    <p>  One of the three pillars to understanding both photography and videography is getting to grips with the aperture of the camera. The aperture refers to the opening of the lens’s diaphragm controlling the amount of light which can be passed through onto the sensor. The numerical measurement of aperture is measured in F-sops normally ranging from f1.4 stepping through to f22. The lower the F number, the larger the aperture allowing for more exposure and the lower the F number the less exposure as the aperture would be smaller. In cinematic film thisphrase is also reffered to as T-stops. </p>

    <p> Depth of field also referred to as Bokeh in Japanese, is defined as the zone of sharpness in front and behind the target subject. Portraits is a good example as they tend to have a very shallow depth of field, as the idea is to focus on the subject which will appear sharp whilst the background will be out of focus. Another example is landscapes, landscapes tend to have a very deep depth of field as the idea is to capture everything in frame to a good degree of sharpness. Relating this back to F/stop, the portrait would use an F number of around 1.4-2.8 respectively whilst a landscape may use anything from F/11 and up. </p>
