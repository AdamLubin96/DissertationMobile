    <p>  White balance is probably one of the most difficult concepts to get to grips with, but it is useful to gain an understanding of it. White balance is adjusting the how the colour white is interpreted under different lighting conditions. For example, fluorescent lighting often gives often gives off a strong blue hue, which is referred to as having a cool temperature. Whereas tungsten or incandescent bulbs often give of a yellowish glow which is associated with being warm. Most digital cameras are equipped with built in white balance settings, although most high-end cameras will allow users to manually adjust the white balance. </p>

    <p>    This images was taken using the incadencent balance. Since the incandecent lighting in this room was limited, there is
          a blue tint which would be less visable providing the incandescent light was stronger. </p>
